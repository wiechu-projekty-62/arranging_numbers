## Game a' la 2048
* Board 4x4 made in Pygame (set of Python modules).
* Every round, an element with the number 2 or 4 appears
* randomly on the board in a random, empty place in the table.
* In each round, we move the elements to the right, left, up or down.
* The same elements come together to add their value.
* A timer that measures the duration of the round appears in the console.
* The goal of the game is to get a score of 2048.
* After reaching the number 2048, the player can continue the game to get more points.
* The game ends when there are no empty spaces on the board
* and there are no blocks that could connect into one in the next move.
* You can end the game at any time by clicking the ESC key
* or the cross in the right top corner of the game window.
* There is a possibility to return to the previous placement of 
* numbers by clicking z key.
